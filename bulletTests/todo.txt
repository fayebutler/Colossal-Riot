* physics world only create agent COLLISION SHAPE 
* agent class creates the rigid body 
- need to make rigid body work in agent class
- need to get collision call back working
- integrate with ngl so control agent ( cylinder )
- Need to make it draw the collision/rigid body rather than random primitive
